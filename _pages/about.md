I am a Faculty Fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University, where I collaborate with [Tal Linzen](https://tallinzen.net). I received my [PhD in computational linguistics](http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1721361736527541) from The Ohio State University, where I worked with [William Schuler](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/schuler.77).

My work aims to advance our understanding of language processing in machines and humans by drawing on techniques from machine learning and psycholinguistics. I am particularly interested in developing computational models that capture the real-time processing behavior of human language users, and interpretability techniques for studying the predictions and representations of neural networks.
